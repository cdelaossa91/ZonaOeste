# Zona Oeste Real State Website

Final Graduation Project for my Web Development Technical Degree.

Even though my client ended up with a website built with Wordpress, I wasn't allowed to present a Wordpress website as a final project.
Instead, I was allowed to create a "dummy" website just for academic purposes. The code provided in this repo is for this "dummy" project.
